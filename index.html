      <p>Erin Gibbons is a student at IU studying Information Systems and Journalism. She often makes a fool of herself and elicits confused looks from strangers. Her loves include the following: <a href="http://twazer.com/blog/2015/07/pixars-inside-out-a-call-to-acknowledgment/" target="_blank">writing</a>, furry-four-legged creatures that <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/c6/b2/e2/c6b2e2eb9b8a0758bde8b96b8ea52822.jpg" target="_blank">aren't cats</a>, bacon, sunshine and singing loudly enough to annoy her neighbors. She also has a mild obsession with quotes she finds on Pinterest. Click on the boxes below to see some of things she has worked on.</p>

          <h2>Article Redesign</h2>
          <p>Here is an article that matches the design of the "News Redesign" project below. Summary of the actual article: Zuckerberg is a bo$$ man.</p>

          <h2>News Redesign</h2>
          <p>It's kind of not really The New York Times. It's The New York Times if the The New York Times was reimagined by a 21-year-old with a 4th grader's aesthetic.</p>

          <h2>Happy Birthday, Rosie</h2>
          <p>My nerd-version of a birthday card for my lovely momma bear. (Since I can't draw, this is a more appealing than a traditionally "hand-made" card.)</p>

          <h2>News Site</h2>
          <p>Please click to enter a very generic news site. Hence the name, "Generic News." (Erin is trying to figure out proper column placement for the skeleton.css file.)</p>

          <p>Using a screenshot as a template, a new page was created in attempt to replicate the page shown.This is Erin's attempt.</p>

          <h2>The Department of Homeland Obscurity</h2>
          <p>Inspired by the endearingly dopey Andy Dwyer from "Parks and Recreation," a chapbook was born. Erin formatted the content chosen by her fellow group members through InDesign to create this journal.</p>

          <h2>YASS</h2>
          <p>A commercial parody about a fabricated drug, called YASS, that mimics the effects of alcohol and marijuana. The video pokes fun at the nature of drug commercials as well as the people that may be interested in such a drug.</p>
