                <h1> Erin Gibbons' Portfolio. </h1>
                <p>Erin Gibbons is a student at IU studying Information Systems and Journalism. She often makes a fool of herself and elicits confused looks from strangers. Her loves include the following: <a href="http://twazer.com/blog/2015/07/pixars-inside-out-a-call-to-acknowledgment/" target="_blank">writing</a>, furry-four-legged creatures that <a href="http://www.bajiroo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/smiling-Funny-Laughing-Dogs-Images-Funny-Pictures-Funny-Photos-by-bajiroo-Fun-Pics-of-Dog-11.jpg" target="_blank">aren't cats</a>, bacon and singing loudly enough to annoy her neighbors.</p>

              <h2>J360 - Lesson 3</h2>
              <p>Using a screenshot as a template, a new page was created in attempt to replicate the page shown. <a href="http://emgibbons.github.io/lesson-3/" target="_blank">This is Erin's attempt</a>.</p>

              <p>A <a href="http://emgibbons.github.io/rio-2016" target="_blank">poster</a> designed for the Rio 2016 Olympics in the likeness of Josef Müller-Brockmann.</p>

              <h2>The Department of Homeland Obscurity</h2>
              <p>Inspired by the endearingly dopey Andy Dwyer from "Parks and Recreation," a chapbook was born. Erin formatted the content chosen by her fellow group members through InDesign to create this <a href="http://issuu.com/officeofhomelandobscurity/docs/the_dept._of_homeland_obscurity" target="_blank">journal</a>.</p>

              <h2>YASS</h2>
              <p>A commercial parody about a fabricated drug, called <a href="http://mediaschool.indiana.edu/j210stlaytonspring15/yass/" target="_blank">YASS</a>, that mimics the effects of alcohol and marijuana. The video pokes fun at the nature of drug commercials as well as the people that may be interested in such a drug.</p>
