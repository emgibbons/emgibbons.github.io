          <h1> Erin Gibbons' Portfolio. </h1>
              <p>Erin Gibbons is a student at IU studying Information Systems and Journalism. She often makes a fool of herself and elicits confused looks from strangers. Her loves include the following: <a href="http://twazer.com/blog/2015/07/pixars-inside-out-a-call-to-acknowledgment/" target="_blank">writing</a>, furry-four-legged creatures that <a href="http://www.bajiroo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/smiling-Funny-Laughing-Dogs-Images-Funny-Pictures-Funny-Photos-by-bajiroo-Fun-Pics-of-Dog-11.jpg" target="_blank">aren't cats</a>, bacon and singing loudly enough to annoy her neighbors. </p>

                <h3>The Department of Homeland Obscurity</h3>
                <p>Inspired by the endearingly dopey Andy Dwyer from "Parks and Recreation," a chapbook was born. With a group of her fellow students, Erin formatted the content chosen by her fellow group members through InDesign to create this <a href="http://issuu.com/officeofhomelandobscurity/docs/the_dept._of_homeland_obscurity" target="_blank">journal</a>.</p>

                <h4>YASS</h4>
                <p>A commercial parody about a fabricated drug, called <a href="http://mediaschool.indiana.edu/j210stlaytonspring15/yass/" target="_blank">YASS</a>, that mimics the combined effects of alcohol and marijuana. The video pokes fun at the nature of drug commercials as well as the people that might be interested in such a drug.</p>
